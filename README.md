### Udacity's 'P1 Movie Trailer' 
This is my version of Udacity's 'P1 Movie Trailer' developed for the Full Stack Web Developer program. It's Movie Trailer Website where users can see some favorite movies of mine and watch the trailers.

### Quick Start
Download the code and extract it
Open your terminal 
Go to the extracted folder
Run the application: python entertainment_center.py
If you hover over a movie the description is shown below
Click on the Movie Title to see youtube trailer


### What's included
Excluding this README.md file there are three python files:

* entertainment_center.py - The main file for this program. Builds a movie list and calls the method to generate the web page.
* fresh_tomatoes.py - Provides the web page generator. It takes a list of movies and builds the HTML to open up your default browser and displays an HTML page.
* media.py - Contains the media class that provides data structure to hold movie information.

A fourth file, fresh_tomatoes.html, is generated when you run the program entertainment_center. This is the web page you  see in your browser.
